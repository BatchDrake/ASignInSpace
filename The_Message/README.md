# The Message
It happened. [We managed to extract the message](https://twitter.com/danieladepaulis/status/1664251594064494595). The message can be downloaded [in raw binary form (MSB first)](../Candidates/artifacts/data17.bin) and [plain text bits (ones and zeroes)](../Candidates/artifacts/data17.txt).

A preliminary analysis, including a potential representation as a picture, [can be found here](analysis/preliminary.md).

The big question therefore remains: **what does it mean?**

This folder attempts to be a compendium of all the theories on the meaning of the message proposed  by the public in the Discord's channel `#interpretation-chat`.


## Current interpretations
