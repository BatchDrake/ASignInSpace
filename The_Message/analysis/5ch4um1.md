# 5ch4um1s interpretation

"What sort of sign? It's hard to explain
because if I say sign to you, you immediately think of a something that can be
distinguished from a something else, but nothing could be distinguished from anything
there"

While looking at the different plots of the image that we now call "Starmap" in the Software Hobbits ( https://github.com/Mahlet-Inc/hobbits )
I noticed that the "Hilbert Plot" looked interesting. Not knowing what a Hilbert curve was, 
I consulted a internet search engine and after seeing a few pretty pictures of all sorts of 
space filling curves, I thought it would be a good idea to also check Youtube.
There i found a video by 3Blue1Brown, a very popular maths channel.
I won't link that video here, you should be able to find it easily.
The program he describes of course sounded interesting, so I decided to try and write it in Perl.
I'm far from an expert in Perl, or programming for that matter, in fact I started using Perl only a few weeks ago.
But as a side note, its creator Larry Wall, happens to be a linguist, and I'd say you can notice that while using it.
Now, back to the curves. That's what they can look like:

![hilbert](https://github.com/5ch4um1/ASignInSpace/assets/36307725/e3b364db-e13b-4602-9627-332f8eadb730)

(You already knew that because you watched the 3b1b video, that's good.)

I thought it might be a good idea to write different scripts that each would do one thing well, and use text as input and output, because text appears to be a universal interface.
So I first wrote/copied a script named hilbertpoints.pl that would create the points of the curve,and then write those points to a text file.
The next script, print.pl, could be used for other things as well, just as a side note. (There are comments at the beginning of each script that explain their usage)
It takes coordinates as input, and contains the 256x256 starmap image as a hardcoded 2d array.
Give it x and y coordinates, and it tells you if the point is a 0 or a 1.
The (pseudo-)Hilbert curve I created would cross each point in the square.
I wrote these resulting points to another file. Then I wrote (mostly copied together that is) another Perl script named convert.pl,
which would take  8 bit bitstrings with a "0b" prefix as input, and convert them to decimal, octal, and hexadecimal, and write the binary data to a file.
The resulting image would look as follows:

Visualizing different permutations of the resulting bitmap yielded interesting patterns, all of which would seem to preserve a general structure.

And here for comparison the same for the original image data:

This might demonstrate a further interesting property of space filling curves.

The screenshots that were used to create those videos were created using the following command, with the files, in this example "starpoints", containing one point per line:

```for i in $(seq 256 512); do cat ~/starpoints | xargs -n $i | tr -d " "| tr "0" " "; echo -e "$i\n";sleep 1;scrot -u; done | egrep --color=always  " |1"```

(Keep in mind that this will write a lot of screenshots to your current working directory)


You might "watch them frame by frame" so to say, with the following command:

```for i in $(seq 256 512); do cat ~/starpoints | xargs -n $i | tr -d " "| tr "0" " "; echo -e "$i\n"; done | egrep --color=always  " |1" | less -r``` 


My current theories about the meaning do need further research and this document will be updated soon.
